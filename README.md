# poolControlle

This software is designed to run in NodeJS on a Raspberry PI, and connect to Home Assistant over MQTT, and to pool valve controller boards I designed over I2C. The firmware for the controller board is located in the poolValveBoard folder.

Further information and the design of the control boards is at my website's [Project Pool PI](https://www.jahartley.com/ProjectPoolPi)
